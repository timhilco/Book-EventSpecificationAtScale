[NOTE] 
This book is a very early draft of this manuscript 
====

This book is being written in AsciiDoc using Visual Studio Code.  
I'm just learning this tool, so I apologize in advance for any bad formatting issues with early versions of the book.

Special thanks to the CloudEvent working group for their review and comments for this book. I would especially like Doug Davis for his support and feedback.

In the examples, HilcoTech is a mythical company.

The author's experience has been in working with large Enterprise Application, such as Human Resources (HR), Benefits Administration, Payroll, Customer Relationship Management and ERP.
These applications tend to have major independent business objects with deeply nested data graphs, along with a high degree of business processes that manage the data objects.
This book should helps architects and event designers coming from these domains.
This is very different than the domains that produce events from real-time environments like cars or sensors.

*All comments welcome*
